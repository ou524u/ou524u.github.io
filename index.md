## About Me

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at Peking University, China. I major in Computer Science.

I aim to create fully virtual Vtubers, with language, voice, avatar, and interaction combined in live-streams. Vtubers provided me with spiritual comfort and strength, and in AI people do seek the same. I aspire to enhance the creativity of Vtubers through 3DV techniques, while leveraging their potential as AI agents. I'm a fan of [Neuro-sama](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Neuro-sama).

I speak Chinese, English, Japanese, German, and Korean.

## Research Interests

- **Neural CG:** Nerual rendering & nerual simulation. 
- **3D Vision:** Digital human & character animation.

Neural revolution within CG pipeline rapidly advanced in nerual rendering, while nerual simulation remains underexplored. I'm particularly interested in incorporating neural techniques/representations into real-world scenarios, unlocking new potentials in 3D Vision tasks.
