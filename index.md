## About Me

I am a 4th-year undergraduate at Peking University, majoring in Information and Computing Science. I will soon begin my PhD studies, co-advised by [Prof. Baoquan Chen](https://baoquanchen.info/) from [VCL Lab](https://vcl.pku.edu.cn/) and [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao) from [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). I am grateful to have been introduced to academic research by [Dr. Wentao Zhu](https://wentao.live/about.html), and guided by [Prof. Mengyu Chu](https://rachelcmy.github.io/).

I aim to create fully virtual Vtubers, with language, voice, avatar, and interaction combined in live-streams. Vtubers provided me with spiritual comfort and strength, and in AI people do seek the same. I aspire to enhance the creativity of Vtubers through 3DV techniques, while leveraging their potential as AI agents. I'm a fan of [Neuro-sama](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Neuro-sama).

I speak Chinese, English, Japanese, German, and Korean.

## Research Interests

- **Neural Graphics:** Nerual rendering & simulation. 
- **3D Human:** Digital avatar & character animation.

Neural revolution within CG pipeline rapidly advanced in nerual rendering, while nerual simulation remains underexplored. I'm particularly interested in incorporating neural techniques/representations into real-world scenarios, unlocking new potentials in 3D Vision tasks.
