## About Me

I am a final year undergraduate at Peking University, major in Information and Computing Science. I will soon begin my PhD studies, co-advised by [Prof. Baoquan Chen](https://baoquanchen.info/) from [VCL Lab](https://vcl.pku.edu.cn/) and [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao) from [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). I am grateful to have been introduced to research by [Dr. Wentao Zhu](https://wentao.live/about.html), and guided by [Prof. Mengyu Chu](https://rachelcmy.github.io/). 

I explore 3D representations for virtual worlds. I believe spatial intelligence is self-supervised. 🌍✨
